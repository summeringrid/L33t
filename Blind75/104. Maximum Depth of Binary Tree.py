        # therefore the storage to keep the call stack would be O(N)

        # so the recurssive approach's space complexity is bound with the stack call
        # the tree traverse memory is relevant to the tree's height and the worst case is the linear tree

        # 2. Iteration (Stack)
        # Time = O(N), Space = O(logN) average
